					<description><![CDATA[Hi Jen, It&#039;s difficult to say without seeing you in person. Chocolate is a good source of magnesium, but often contains a lot of sugar which is why we tell our cancer patients not to eat any chocolate less than 85% and to avoid all added sugar including honey, maple syrup, and fruit juices. Avoiding sugar is crucial for everyone&#039;s well-being, and if you can&#039;t avoid the sweet we recommend using stevia instead of sugar of artificial sweeteners. 

Other than that would recommend an office consult with a local naturopathic physician, they will be able to discuss your personal situation and prescribe a best course of action. This site may be able to help you find a naturopath in your area http://www.naturopathic.org/ We wish you the best of luck!]]></description>
