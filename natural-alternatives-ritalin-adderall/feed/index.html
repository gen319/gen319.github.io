					<description><![CDATA[Hello, I found your blog initially while I was looking for natural alternatives to Adderall two weeks ago. I just wanted to post this comment now because even though this post is for children, it still helped me as a college student. I am not sure if you are aware of this, but students across campuses have also begun to abuse the stimulants you mentioned, such as ritalin and adderall. I completely agree with your points and the one that really stood out to me was the paragraph where you mentioned: Maria Montessori and the Sicilian remedy with regards to the shot of espresso. Anyway, I thought about how the same level of focus and concentration can be achieved through natural routes. For me, coffee still makes me jittery. And it&#039;d be awesome if you could explain some of the different stimulants or combinations that would be helpful in the pursuit of natural enhancement in focus. Personally, I am now taking a natural alternative supplement, Limidax, now, and I take Limidax since it continues to give me a natural boost in focus and concentration day to day. It makes sense
too as to why now, since it has the ingredients you mentioned in your article. Plus the small amount of caffeine you&#039;d get in an espresso, except Limidax gets it from Green Tea, which I do think is healthier than coffee everyday. Although I&#039;d really like to hear from you if you could say if Green Tea is a better alternative to coffee? I had done a little research online, and it seemed to me that people were mentioning that the L-Theanine with caffeine gave more focus and decreased the side effects some people have from caffeine. Anyway, I just wanted to thank you for your helpful article!]]></description>
