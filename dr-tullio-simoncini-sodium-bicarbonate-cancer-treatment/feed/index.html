					<description><![CDATA[I subsist far below the poverty level.  I only have medicare and medicaid.  How screwed am I?  I already have a port and I had chemo until after it had turned into a revival of the Spanish Inquisition.  I was also blasted with radiation.  Then I decided that enough was enough.  I am definitely open to any available alternatives, even if they will only help reverse some of the damaging effects of chemo and radiation.  I began a regimen of oral baking soda solution today.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was unfortunately diagnosed with male breast cancer recently. It is fully treatable and only stage two and not a very aggressive type. I am going for the operation in a few weeks. However, I read about the bicarb treatment and I decided to try it to try to shrink the tumor down before the operation. What I am about to tell you is the TRUTH ! For about the last 6 weeks I have been taking one teaspoon of bicarb mixed with honey {one part bicarb three pars honey} heat it a little so it mixes up easier. I also added a small amount of very concentrated green tea so the mixture is easier to drink. I also added a piece on cinnamon bark {whole cinnamon} while the green tea steeped in a cup. OK, my tumor was measured 3.2 centimeters 8 weeks ago and now, it is 2.2 centimeters as I had it measured at the hospital by a nurse a few days ago. Also, the itching that is accommodated by this kind of cancer has stopped. So there you go.... If you want more info let me know]]></description>
