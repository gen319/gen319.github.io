								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The first thing to expect from a naturopathic oncologist is that he or she will listen to you.</p>
<p>Cancer does not arise overnight, and often there is a history of exposure to toxins, radiation or other past assault. Many times even the patient does not know or is not sure what event in their past was most causative of cancer. An initial consult of an hour or more is necessary to try to identify such events, in order to make a plan to reverse damage to the greatest extent possible.</p>
<p>The initial assault leading to cancer varies widely from person to person. However, it is really necessary to try to dig through past history to see if that can be found. Sometimes we meet with auto workers who handled brake pads with asbestos, or people who lived or worked near crop dusters, or under an industrial smokestack. In other cases, there may be extraordinarily high levels of estrogen, or perhaps there were solvents that a person was exposed to. To the extent that these exposures can be reversed, we can get to work on that.</p>
<p>We also do a physical exam, to assess the extent of cancer in the body. We also look at imaging, examining together the CDs or films that patients bring in of their CTs, PET/CTs, MRIs, ultrasounds and x-rays. We piece together a picture of the current tumor burden in the body.</p>
<p>Finally, it’s time to talk about treatments. Conventional treatments for cancer are discussed with respect to the individual and his or her tumor burden. There are very different considerations for different parts of the body.</p>
<p>Natural treatments are discussed with the same considerations. Where is the cancer? We fight cancer differently in the lungs than in the prostate, for example. How aggressive is the cancer? Where in the body did it begin? How widespread is it? What is the most precarious or difficult or threatening metastasis? For example, is it wrapped around the aorta? Is it pressing on an eye or ear? Is it pressing against the central bile duct or a ureter? So various suggestions for treatments are given, very often including recommendations for surgery, with all of these considerations. Some patients also consider radiation treatment for an especially precarious tumor burden.</p>
<p>In any case, naturopathic physicians are trained, examined and licensed to practice both conventional and natural medicine. Therefore, naturopathic physicians are uniquely qualified to discuss both your conventional options and your naturopathic options with you. We honor the Patient Bill of Rights, as shown in the Informed Consent on <a href="http://www.NatOnco.org">www.NatOnco.org</a>.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Colleen Huber, NMD</p>
<p>It is a long-held (and heavily purchased) dogmatic belief that chemotherapy is the weapon of choice against cancer.&nbsp; There are some problems with this:</p>
<p>One, there usually is no choice given.&nbsp; Newly diagnosed cancer patients are not told that there are any options other than chemotherapy.&nbsp; If a patient suggests to the oncologist that alternatives exist, that patient is usually told:&nbsp; But your cancer would respond especially well to chemotherapy.</p>
<p>Two, chemotherapy is been oversold for its anti-cancer effect, and has been falsely promoted as effective against all cancers.&nbsp; A July 2017 article in <a href="http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/9/397/eaan0026">Science Translational Medicine</a> <a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[1]</a> found that chemotherapy actually <strong><em>increases</em></strong> the risk of metastasis.&nbsp; This is what makes cancer especially deadly and beyond medical control.</p>
<p>Although chemotherapy generally dramatically reduces the size of tumors, not only does the remaining cancer metastasize more readily, but it also becomes more resilient to all subsequent treatment.</p>
<p>After 10 years of working with cancer patients, I have become more and more convinced that the worst thing a cancer patient can do is choose to have chemotherapy.&nbsp; Those are the people who get sick and die, in my experience.&nbsp; Whereas those who avoid it have generally had much <a href="https://natureworksbest.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2017-Cancer-treatment-paper.2017.12.30.pdf">better success</a><a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2">[2]</a> in eliminating cancer from their bodies for the long-term.</p>
<p>Chemotherapy has been a financial boon to hospitals.&nbsp; Whereas “health” insurance has been slow or stubborn about paying for cheaper alternatives, those same insurance companies lavish enormous sums on oncology clinics for exorbitantly priced chemotherapy drugs, some of which can cost upward of $40,000 per dose.</p>
<p>The chemotherapy paradigm has been a misguided paradigm for cancer treatment, ever since it was first recycled from World War I and II chemical weapons.&nbsp; Isn’t it time to consider the many safe and effective <a href="https://www.natonco.org/">natural alternatives</a> <a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3">[3]</a> that exist?</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;">Chemo, Radiation &amp; Surgery &#8211; Poison, Burn, &amp; Cut</h2>
<p>On the most visible side of the whole field of cancer are chemotherapy, radiation and surgery. Some cancer patients refer to these simply as &#8220;poison, burn and cut.&#8221; For all the drastic effects on the body of such treatments, they have been the treatment of choice for the vast majority of cancer patients. Of course, many of these people do not know that alternatives exist, and are not informed of natural medical alternatives by anyone they know, least of all their doctors. Even more boldly, the advocates of chemo, radiation and surgery in the medical community are in the forefront of the news media talking about an imminent &#8220;cure&#8221; for cancer within the next few years, with themselves cast as the leading roles in the forefront of the search for a cure.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, as if in a completely different plane of reality, there are those of us who work with cancer patients and natural treatments having a very different, very positive and health-affirming experience, and are not anywhere near the attention of the media regarding a possible cure. The reason for this is that nearly a century of intimidation has taught those of us who practice natural medicine that we&#8217;d better adhere to some basic guidelines regarding our place in the world. These are:</p>
<ol>
<li>That our place is at the outskirts of the medical field, as enforced by the FDA, and by our exclusion from hospital privileges, and that if we know what&#8217;s good for us, we&#8217;d better not forget that; that medical doctors have a higher social rank and consider themselves to be at a more powerful and authoritative professional rank than any other health care practitioner;</li>
<li>That natural medicine must be suppressed to the point that it is merely complementary to the mainstream medicine of drugs and surgery and must only be used to the extent that it does not interfere with or preclude mainstream medicine;</li>
<li>That regardless of the successes that we in natural medicine have had getting cancer patients into remission or helping them to stay in remission, we must never dare to express to anyone else (other health care professionals, cancer patients, the public in general, or the media) that we have had those successes;</li>
<li>That we must pretend that there is freedom of speech regarding health and medicine despite the above severe restrictions that exist on that freedom, and that we should not complain about those restrictions.</li>
</ol>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Natural Medicine</h2>
<p>From those outside the mainstream medical profession, including former insiders, much has been written about the mainstream efforts to exclude natural medicine. A fascinating exploration of this is Dr. Ralph Moss&#8217;s book The Cancer Industry, in which he describes his experiences as a cancer researcher and his fall from the cancer establishment once he disclosed his research showing a natural method to be more effective than mainstream methods at eliminating tumors.</p>
<p>In fact, there are a number of natural cancer treatments that have shown greater effect than mainstream treatments. Because of inadequate and incomplete information about all the available natural cancer treatments, many patients make choices among these based on what they happen to hear about through the grapevine or stumble across on the internet.</p>
<p>At our office, we have been very fortunate to be able to get many of our cancer patients into remission, with very few coming out of remission. For me, as their physician, I have to acknowledge what has worked in cancer treatment and what does not. This is the only way that we can maintain such good results.</p>
<p>The most effective strategy for us has definitely been a multiple treatment strategy. I emphasize diet with my cancer patients as much as the individual natural medical treatments. In all cases, my treatment of cancer is aggressive. That is, we attack the cancer continually. However, in my practice, my cancer treatment is entirely natural. I use no chemotherapy or other pharmaceuticals to fight cancer.</p>
<p>Treatments are entirely tailored to the individual. A breast cancer patient will get a different treatment protocol than a lung cancer patient. And different individuals with similar cancers may have somewhat different treatments.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether the treatments are natural or mainstream, these must be aggressive, simply because cancer is a very aggressive disease. Either you kill it, or it kills you, and this happens continually. Cancer has been called a race against time. Unlike many other diseases processes, in which the patient has the option of waiting and watching and pondering the various options, your best chance of defeating cancer is with an early start in fighting it. We have also succeeded in helping people who started late, but that has come at the cost of a huge amount of time fighting the cancer, with additional expense to the patient.</p>
<p>Patients have traveled from various parts of the west and Midwest for the cancer treatments that we offer at our office. Because it usually takes a number of months, usually at least 2-3 months, up to at least several months, to get a patient into remission, it is usually a good idea for patients to plan on renting a place to live while here in the Phoenix area for the duration of the treatments.</p>

<p>Studies continue to affirm that a majority of cancer patients use some form of natural medicine. A brief summary follows:</p>

<p>Studies done throughout the world, in the US, UK, Australia, Turkey, Brazil, Norway, Switzerland, and The Netherlands show that CAM (complementary and alternative medicine) is being used everywhere.</p>
