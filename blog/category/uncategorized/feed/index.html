<h2 style="text-align: center;">Sunshine, Food, Exercise And Supplements vs Drugs</h2>
<p>The majority of my patients who have come to me on anti-depressant drugs have been able to get off of them, with the help of some of the following recommendations.</p>
<p>Some cases of depression are mostly the result of inadequate perfusion and thus an inadequately functioning brain. One of the best naturopathic physicians and teachers I know, Dr. Kenneth Proefrock, doesn&#8217;t usually oversimplify, but he does say, &#8220;It&#8217;s all about blood flow.&#8221; What he means is that blood carries oxygen and nutrients, which are absolutely, can&#8217;t-live-without-them, essential for all parts of the brain and body, including the repair of things that go wrong there. In &#8220;Breaking the Age Barrier,&#8221; authors Wassef and Torkos claim that by age 50 blood flow to the brain has dropped by about 20 percent. Arterial plaque in the vessels that supply the brain, the carotid arteries, narrow the diameter of these blood-giving vessels, which reduces the flow, and thus reduces the brain&#8217;s best advantage for full-functioning. Thus we end up walking into a room only to find we&#8217;ve forgotten what we came in for, or can&#8217;t think of something we recently learned. The depression most characteristic of middle and older ages revolves around the concern for what brain function is becoming lost.</p>
<p>The brain is especially sensitive to any deficit of blood flow and the nutrients carried by blood. This is why one of the first symptoms of inadequate blood sugar or oxygen is grogginess, headache, dizziness, irritability, etc. The brain is the most dependent on and therefore the first to complain when any of the essentials go missing.</p>
<p>Here is some of what is needed for adequate brain function:</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Oxygen, Fresh Air And Negatively Charged Ions</h2>
<p>In the absence of adequate oxygen the brain dies in a few minutes or suffers irreversible damage. To a lesser extent, remaining in a stuffy indoor environment makes us a little dopey. During the summer thunderstorms and at cooler times of day, crack open a window now and then.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Sunlight</h3>
<p>Sunlight arrives to the brain by means of the eyes. So try to get some outdoor time with unfiltered light. The natural light received by the eyes plays a vital role in body and brain chemistry. The light received by the eyes influences the hypothalamus, which in turn influences the pituitary and pineal glands. The pineal gland especially is involved in our diurnal rhythms, and our lack of quality light through the retina may be the source of many sleep disorders that are increasingly common among people who are always indoors. Disordered sleep is one of the first signs of depression.</p>
<p>Much research on this subject is summarized by the German ophthalmologist Fritz Hollwich, MD [1] as well as by John Ott, Hon. D. Sci. a researcher on the properties of light. [2] The array of bodily organs and systems that depend on full-spectrum light through the eyes is astounding. When the eyes are exposed to natural sunlight or full-spectrum light, the pituitary gland, thyroid gland, adrenal glands, ovaries, testes, pancreas, liver and kidneys all function better, according to the numerous studies presented in these two books. Full-spectrum light includes a balance of wavelengths from all colors of the visible spectrum plus ultraviolet and infrared. On the other hand, cool white fluorescent bulbs, which are now used for the great majority of interior commercial lighting, have strong yellow, but are very deficient in most of the other wavelengths, with no ultraviolet or infrared.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, however, UV light has received a bad name, primarily because of individuals who have a history of blistering sunburns followed by skin cancer. There has never been any research showing health benefits of blocking UV light to the eyes. However, it is now impossible to buy eyeglasses that allow full-spectrum light. All of the lenses made in the last ten years for eyeglasses are made to block UV light, even plastic lenses, which if untreated, allow full-spectrum light.</p>
<p>Earl Staelin, writing in the Well Being Journal, summarizes the recommendations of those who have studied light and its health effects, and recommends that individuals who must wear glasses try to get outdoors everyday for 20 to 60 minutes or more without wearing any glasses, because the amount of UV light that strikes the retina from around the edges of glasses is insignificant compared to the large amount of light coming through the eye through the lenses. The full spectrum of daylight need not come from direct sunlight, but is available also on a cloudy day or under the shade of a tree or porch. Glass windows however, do block out UV light, so try to get out in the fresh air if at all possible.</p>
<p>For an especially busy person, eating your breakfast outdoors, weather permitting, may be the only option.</p>
<p>On days when even this is difficult, there is yet another recourse, which is distilled cod liver oil. The distillation takes out mercury and other heavy metals, which are all too prevalent in both salt and freshwater fish. Cod liver oil is high in vitamins D and A. Just 2 tablespoons a day has been found to completely eliminate psoriasis, a disease that conventional medicine only knows to suppress with steroid drugs. However, for your optimal intake, depending on your sun exposure and weight, you should really check with your naturopathic physician.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Exercise</h3>
<p>The importance of exercise to overall health cannot be overemphasized. It has been pointed out that an athlete who eats junk food is better off than a couch potato who eats the healthiest possible food. (For a worst-case scenario, a couch potato who eats junk food is diabetes and stroke just waiting to happen.) As vital as good food is to health, exercise is even more essential. It&#8217;s pretty much a choice of move or slowly die. In a study of 18,000 women it was found that greater physical activity has been associated with less cognitive decline. That&#8217;s a lot of women! It doesn&#8217;t get much more persuasive than that.</p>
<p>Exercise also releases endorphins, the body&#8217;s own &#8220;feel-good&#8221; chemicals. Considering the very physically active lifestyles our distant ancestors had, it is probably not such a bad or dangerous idea to get some more of these &#8220;feel good&#8221; chemicals flowing through our brains, at least a bit more than today&#8217;s sedentary people have in circulation.</p>
<p>It is almost impossible to be depressed with a rigorous exercise program. You&#8217;d have to try hard, always stay indoors and only eat junk food.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">Social Interaction</h4>
<p>People who are socially isolated are more likely to have dementia and depression, and begin to suffer from those at a younger age than those who are involved in social or family interactions. Stay involved or get involved.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">Education Is For Everyone</h4>
<p>Some people say college is wasted on the young, because too many other distractions early in life can obscure the great value that is possible to obtain from a college education. Continue learning new things throughout your life, and make yourself continue to remember what you learned, whether through review or incorporation into your other activities. Studies have shown that people who maintained more mental activity through learning and social interaction had lower incidence of Alzheimers. Another quote from Dr. Proefrock: &#8220;Self-improvement is the best anti-depressant.&#8221; Education gives you something to shoot for, to aspire to, to look forward to and to work and plan for.</p>
<h5 style="text-align: center;">Food</h5>
<p>If your brain is not supplied with proper nutrients, it cannot be expected to function any better than a poorly nourished body. You know what I&#8217;m talking about, because it&#8217;s just like your grandmom told you: eat your vegetables, some raw. Get fresh fruit. Have some meat or other good quality protein like rice and beans. Don&#8217;t eat dessert. Sugar is one of the worst culprits in depression. Giving up sugar alone will usually get people out of depression.</p>
<p>Children diagnosed with depression, when advised that if they stop eating sugar their depression will go away, usually rise to this challenge and heal themselves naturally without drugs. Grant your children this learning experience if they are already suffering from mood disorders.</p>
<p>The above are some of the basic essentials for good brain function and good mood.</p>
<p>There is another list, of things that should be avoided in order to ensure mental well-being:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Medications</strong>: Over the counter and prescription medications have been notorious for decreasing optimum brain functioning. The same mechanisms that stop transmission of pain signals and other symptom awareness are also capable of interfering with thoughts and emotions that also transmit via neurons.</li>
<li><strong>Alcoholism</strong> &#8211; with continued drinking to the point of addiction, the option to drink in order to place one&#8217;s worries aside is less urgent than getting a drink to quench the craving. Alcohol is toxic to neurons and causes lasting as well as temporary disablement of thought, speech, coordination, judgment and mood regulation.</li>
<li><strong>Heavy metal exposure</strong>: Lead, mercury and aluminum are common toxic metals that many of us are storing in our fat cells. Since the brain is 60% fat, we keep these poisonous chemicals there, tightly bound to our fat cells. Your naturopathic physician can chelate out these metals, which brings your brain function back to levels unknown for even years.</li>
<li><strong>Vitamin B12 deficit</strong>: This is a common deficiency because it is absorbed in the intestines, which are not at optimal functioning in most people. Your naturopathic physician can correct this very easily with a shot of B12 and folate (the most commonly deficient nutrient), along with a repair program for your intestines. The shot takes less than a minute and feels less ouchy than even a mosquito bite.</li>
<li><strong>Metabolic diseases</strong>, including diabetes, thyroid disease or other pathologies involving the liver, kidneys or lungs. The brain is most sensitive of all organs to losses of nutrients, oxygen and blood flow, and the most vulnerable to interruptions in circulation or airflow to the lungs.</li>
<li><strong>Inflammation</strong> from any cause that results in general nervous system inflammation can impede the flow of information processing in the brain.</li>
</ul>
<h5 style="text-align: center;">What You Can Do To Improve Brain Function</h5>
<ul>
<li><strong>Get what you need and take out the garbage</strong>. Your naturopathic physician can test you for excessive amounts of brain-depleting substances, such as candida or heavy metals. There are also lab tests that they can order to determine if inflammatory processes are at work in your body. There are ways of determining if arteriosclerosis is a problem that interferes with blood flow to the brain. ADHD, depression, anxiety, substance dependence, chronic fatigue and fibromyalgia can all manifest with symptoms of brain fog, and all of these are usually greatly improved by naturopathic medicine.</li>
<li><strong>5-HTP</strong> helps make serotonin, which is one of the brain&#8217;s &#8220;happy&#8221; neurotransmitters. Depressed people often have low levels of serotonin. Prescription anti-depressants don&#8217;t help this situation much, because it takes those low levels and keeps them in circulation more. What 5-HTP does is actually increase your serotonin, because 5-HTP is a precursor to serotonin. You will see this at your local health food store, but it is best if you see your naturopathic physician before starting this, because you might not be low in serotonin at all, but rather another essential neurotransmitter. And that would require a totally different treatment.</li>
<li><strong>Other supplements</strong>, fish oil or cod liver oil (now flavored with lemon which makes a spoonful much more tolerable), ginkgo, B-vitamins, and Acetyl-L-carnitine are all wonderful for brain function and can be found in health food stores.</li>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;">Make Sure Of The Following Before Considering Sleep Sedatives</h2>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">Don&#8217;t Ignore Thirst Early In The Day.</h4>
<p>Many people don&#8217;t feel thirsty early in the day and forget to drink water. Then, during your activities over the course of the day, you continually breathe out water vapor and continually sweat at least small unnoticeable amounts. That water loss adds up to a mild dehydration over the course of the day until the evening arrives and you finally notice that you&#8217;re thirsty. So then you start to drink such a wonderfully refreshing glass of water that you have another. And perhaps a third. . .</p>
<p>So now the bladder has just been wound up as an alarm clock. The trouble is it will go off around midnight and then again in the wee hours of the morning. Many people find that after a trip to the bathroom, the brief walk was enough to wake them up and they try to go back to sleep, but it may take hours to fall asleep again.</p>
<p>The moral of the story is to try to remember to start drinking water earlier in the day.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Are You Getting Enough Exercise?</h2>
<p>Remember the feeling of &#8220;a good kind of tired&#8221; from your teenage years? That feeling does not have to be exclusively enjoyed by teenagers. Your exercise routine should be frequent; at least 3 days per week, and intense enough that you would have trouble holding a conversation during the most intense parts of it. While gradually working up to such intensity over time, you should get to the point where you push yourself to the exertion that makes you break a sweat everyday that you exercise. Totally sedentary people tend to have light, easily disturbed sleep. People who really work out are on average better able to get a relaxing, prolonged sleep.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Is Your Bedroom Dark?</h2>
<p>Even a little of ambient light in your bedroom &#8211; even from a small nightlight or clock radio &#8211; can shut down your melatonin production for the night. Melatonin is one wonderful substance that your brain makes, and you definitely don&#8217;t want to be without it.</p>
<p>Melatonin is produced by the pineal gland and it has the effects of allowing sleep and has recently shown evidence of being preventative of cancer.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Are There Electrical Fixtures Near Your Bed?</h2>
<p>When the brain needs to relax for sleep, it does not need the constant stimulation of electro-magnetic waves. The cell phone, the touch-lamps, the clock radio and other high-EMF items should be removed away from the bed. If the other side of your bedroom wall is where the circuit breakers are located, perhaps your bed could be moved away from that wall.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Have You Had Exposure To Full-Spectrum Sunlight Recently?</h3>
<p>Windows, glasses and contact lenses all limit UV light and cut down on our exposure to full-spectrum sunlight. Try to get out in the sunlight for an average of 20 minutes per day, or at least an hour on Saturday and an hour on Sunday, without glasses or contact lenses. Even if you are under the shade of a tree or a porch, you are allowing the sun to reset the internal clock of your pineal gland. This lets the pineal gland know that now is really and truly daylight, so that later will be really and truly nighttime and will allow you to sleep.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Can You Even Make Enough Melatonin?</h2>
<p>Tryptophan is an amino acid (piece of a protein) that is the precursor for melatonin. You need enough tryptophan in your diet to be able to make melatonin.</p>
<p>It is high in cottage cheese, turkey (accounting for notoriously sedentary behavior after Thanksgiving dinner), Parmesan and cheddar cheeses and sesame seeds, for example.</p>
<p>Try to make sure you get some of these foods in your diet.</p>
<p>Try these tips first for sleep. If you still need help falling and staying asleep, your local naturopathic physician can evaluate your individual case for nutritional supplements and herbs that can be helpful in your case for getting back to sleep.</p>
<p>See www.naturopathic.org for the largest directory of board-certified, state-licensed naturopathic physicians in the United States.</p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;">Part I</h2>
<p>During at least some of childhood the grass is definitely greener elsewhere. One of the biggest challenges to your family&#8217;s healthy lifestyle is your children&#8217;s perception that other people are privileged simply because they eat differently. The parents&#8217; strategic awareness and preparation for the child&#8217;s fascination with the Standard American Diet (SAD) is paramount.</p>
<p>Adults also fall into conforming to SAD just because so many other people are doing it. To which I respond: what law states that you must conform 100% to all majority cultural practices, including some of those practices that are kind of dumb?</p>
<p>At no time is the parents&#8217; advantage greater than in earliest childhood for understanding the crucial role of food in setting the course for either chronic disease or a lifetime of good health. At no other time is the parent&#8217;s advantage greater for establishing a healthy routine. By the time the child is ready to start school, he or she is already developing a strong interest in being like their friends and doing what their friends are doing.</p>
<p>Use your advantage of a head start. You care way more about the quality of your child&#8217;s food for several years, including pregnancy, before your child begins to feel pulled by the influence of those outside the family. Use that time to create a bubble of a near-perfectly healthy lifestyle that your child will get used to and will associate with home and family for the rest of his or her life. Changing to a whole food diet can of course be accomplished later, at the expense of tantrums, grumbling and other exaggerations of angst. The earlier you do it the easier.</p>
<p>An easy, healthy routine is your greatest strength, because when you start getting used to buying, preparing and eating whole organic foods, and when you make such foods the first thing that you reach for and the first impulse for meal preparation, then you are teaching your children their basic foundation diet and fulfilling their expectations of healthy good food being a part of their daily lives.</p>
<p>The goal is for your children to reach for whole rather than processed foods, to value those produced without synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, MSG, sweeteners and preservatives. They learn from familiar experience to appreciate the great energized feeling that they get from a glass of raw milk or a handful of carrot sticks or a meal with dark leafy greens. If you are just now transitioning to a whole food diet, let your children fill up on as much whole healthy food as they want. The practical advantage of eating whole fresh foods is that they substitute, by their sheer bulk, the chemicals and denatured food derivatives that we might otherwise eat.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Starting Your Children Off Right</h2>
<p>My suggestions for starting your kids off right are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>The earlier you start the easier and the more effective your efforts. Breastfed kids have huge health advantages. You will never again have the opportunity to make such a strong health impact in such a short amount of time, and for less effort and expense than formula feeding. Even if circumstances only allowed you to breastfeed your child for a short time, the advantages are enormous and will be manifest throughout your child&#8217;s life.</li>
<li>The first solid foods should be whole foods: cooked squash, carrot, broccoli and other vegetables, avocado, banana, watermelon, etc. Snacks and meals for toddlers and preschoolers should be entirely whole foods. The beverage is water, and that&#8217;s it, until you find a raw milk source. And even then, the main beverage is water. Toddlers do not need to know that things like pasta and ice cream exist. Parents who exclaim, &#8220;But how can I feed them healthy food when macaroni and cheese is the only thing that they&#8217;ll eat?&#8221; have started off with the wrong items in the kitchen, and are going to have to go through some tantrums in order to establish a better way of eating. This will be made easier if you keep your television away from them.</li>
<li>TV teaches a processed food and pharmaceutical lifestyle. The messages are delivered continually: either eat out, or open a package to get your ready-made food, pour yourself a glass of colored liquid, and your life is just not happy until you take a pill. If you have to keep de-programming what the TV is programming, you won&#8217;t be able to compete; nobody can. TV is so flashy and persuasive that you&#8217;ll be like Sisyphus always having to roll his rock back up the hill.Either get rid of the TV, or keep it in a room that always remains locked, to be viewed together only occasionally, when an appropriate movie is to be seen. Kids raised without TV are easily spotted by their teachers. They&#8217;re the ones with good focus and lengthened attention span.Some families who decide against TV after their kids are already hooked resolve things this way: One day the TV becomes mysteriously &#8220;broken,&#8221; and they just don&#8217;t get around to buying a new one. Or the TV has to make way for some new bookshelves and ends up on a high shelf in the garage. Anybody who wants to watch it has to go stand next to the car to do so. Suddenly the flashiness loses a lot of its grip on your children&#8217;s minds.</li>
<li>Your children&#8217;s first friends will tend to be those whose parents you befriend. In other words, almost any two little kids close in age who spend time together will end up playing together, but you are the one who has the discretion to choose your friends wisely. So make your choices of your child&#8217;s playmates before your child gets around to it. It is very important to your efforts toward a whole food household to bring into your lives moms and dads who are committed to roughly the same kind of diet you are, especially if you also must battle junk-food peddling relatives or school administrators.When your children see others outside of your family eating healthy food, they will understand that it is not just some weird quirk of yours, but that there actually exists a community of like-minded healthy people. When enough of these friends have been gathered into your lives, it will also become obvious to your child that the whole food people look a whole lot healthier than the junk food junkies.If you don&#8217;t have a big enough sample size to convince your children of this, take them to the biggest health food store that you know and have them observe the customers. Then take them into a typical supermarket, and have them observe the customers. After you leave, let them discuss comparisons. In which store were people generally heavier and more fatigued-looking? In which store did they see more energetic, moderate weight people of all ages? That kind of powerfully persuasive evidence would even give pause to a teenager who is tempted by fast food eating peers.</li>
<li>Keep junk food out of the house. Naturopathic physician Dr. Kenneth Proefrock says the battle over good food is won or lost at the supermarket. If you can walk past processed food at the supermarket and keep on going then you&#8217;ve won. But if cookies made it into your shopping cart, they will make it to your cupboards, and you will end up eating them all and regretting them. Do yourself and your kids a favor. When you&#8217;re all shopping together, don&#8217;t even bother going down the processed foods aisles. Shop the periphery where the vegetables, fruits, meats and dairy are, and that&#8217;s it. Involve your children by letting them make choices among all of those. Pears, peaches or plums? Spinach, mustard greens or romaine? Poultry, fish or red meat? Their choices will be all the tastier when you get home, because each of them got to make those choices.</li>
<li>Self-esteem is important to your children&#8217;s comfort with their diet. Your children also have to participate in social structures involving a significant number of children who eat differently. The challenge is to help your children maintain their self-esteem and to honor the food choices of their family while also being respectful of others&#8217; food choices. All this should be accomplished with a minimum of awkwardness and isolation. One family shops for mostly organic food, but also at large warehouse supermarkets, where various appetizers are offered to the shoppers around the store. Their five-year old daughter summarized her family&#8217;s food choices by saying,&#8221; Look, hot dogs. That&#8217;s okay, Mommy. We don&#8217;t eat that. We eat different food, and that&#8217;s okay too.&#8221; Regressing from the wisdom of this five-year old, the older child&#8217;s fear of being different will be fairly calamitous, especially in adolescence, unless there is a strong awareness and self-respect regarding the individual&#8217;s right to eat differently than most, and the good reasons for doing so.Talking to your children is the most important. The more that differences become obvious to your children between their diets and others&#8217; diets, the more talk is needed. It is very important for your children to know that their healthy lifestyle is at the vanguard of the direction society is moving in, not at the rear. For example, it should be explained to your children that processed food companies are using much less of trans-fatty acids than just a few years ago. Also, fast food chains are offering healthier options now, following their comeuppance from the film &#8220;Supersize Me&#8221; and other public criticism. School districts are getting continued pressure from parents to disallow soft drink and junk food vending machines in their children&#8217;s schools. Consistently, a majority of parents surveyed oppose such machines. Now also, a majority of adults surveyed said they would prefer to eat organic food if it were available in their area at a comparable price to non-organic.Let your children appreciate that your family is way more advanced than many others just because you know how vital it is to eat right. It is gratifying to know that the world is moving in a good direction. Organic food is growing at 12% per year. Even the mighty McDonald&#8217;s bowed to the public outcry for healthier food. Now your children just need to practice patience as the rest of the world catches up to your trend setting.</li>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;">A Healthy Halloween</h2>
<p>As a primary care physician, I see the first real wave of the cold season in the first few weeks after Halloween. Typically, patients will come in with runny nose, sore throat, cough, etc., with a story that goes something like this: &#8220;Well, the kids brought home these huge bags of Halloween candy, and I was thinking I should throw them away, but we ended up eating the whole thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>These stories are very familiar and unsurprising. The connection between the common cold and sugar consumption is as follows: When you consume sugar, the white blood cells, which are the soldiers of your immune system, are inactivated for between 5 and 24 hours afterward. [1] As a result, the opportunistic rhinoviruses and coronaviruses that cause colds are unopposed in their invasion of your respiratory mucous membranes. The usual cold symptoms often result.</p>
<p>Our family does something a little different for Halloween. My son puts on his costume, and then has the very important job of dispensing treats when we answer the door together. Those treats are basically party favors: pens, tops, rubbery lizards, plastic sunglasses, light-up balls, etc. They are a bit more expensive per child than candy, even at one toy per child. But that is our way of not pumping more sugar into the neighborhood kids.</p>
<p>When I was a kid, we did something similar. Mom gave us kids little stapled bags of popcorn that she had popped, to hand out to the trick or treaters. She did this every year when I was growing up, and the popcorn was often still warm in the bags when we handed it out. It was a good alternative to the candy that kids mostly received.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Make Your Own Sweets With Healthy Sweeteners</h2>
<p>Some other ways you can have a healthier Halloween is to make your own sweets with healthy sweeteners. The only two really benign sweeteners out there, that are not artificial or alcohol sugars or with a high glycemic index, are stevia and agave nectar.</p>
<p>Stevia has a glycemic index of zero, so it will not raise your blood sugar, and in some cases lowers it. [2, 3] Stevia is probably the most mishandled of any sweetener. Almost all of my patients who tried it used the powder and found that they got so much that a bitter after-taste resulted. This is because stevia is many times sweeter than sugar, and it is easy to get too much. I strongly recommend using the liquid stevia instead, and just using a few drops to start. For example, I make a glass of lemonade by squeezing 1/4 lemon into a 16 oz glass of water. Then I add 8 drops of liquid stevia. From there, you can adjust to taste.</p>
<p>A variety of stevia recipes are on this link at stevia.com. I would start with the cold or room temperature recipes first for the best results.</p>
<p>Agave nectar is more versatile than stevia and is somewhat closer to the taste of sugar. It has a glycemic index of 27, not quite zero, but certainly lower than many other foods, many including vegetables, meats and dairy. You can bake with it, and use it in a variety of recipes. Here are some agave recipes online.</p>
<p>If the food in your house is part of the problem, and Halloween leaves its dregs behind all year long, start shopping just the periphery of the supermarket where the whole foods are. Skip the aisles of processed and sweetened foods and drinks. Leaving bad food behind at the supermarket makes a whole food/sugar-free diet a whole lot easier. Whatever you do, don&#8217;t bring the cookies and ice cream home to your kitchen, where they then sit there a few feet away from you like ticking bombs, and quickly find their way into everybody&#8217;s tummies. (You are only human after all. Don&#8217;t make your temptations any more difficult than they already are by bringing them into your house.) Start the clean sweep of your pantry during a weekend, so that neither you nor your children will be tempted by junk outside the home within those first critical 48 hours. When the cravings become bothersome, massage all of both ears to cover the ear acupuncture points related to addiction. Broccoli, cheese and liver are foods high in chromium, which is helpful specifically for sugar cravings. Drinking water is the best way to flush out toxins and metabolites more quickly.</p>
<p>On creating a whole food household for the first time, your children may balk, but within a few days, they will 1) learn to accept the food that you are providing them, and 2) will then let you know that they are feeling better. During the usually sniffly weeks after Halloween, you will be glad that you have already embarked on a healthier way of life.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;">Prickly Pear (Nopal In Spanish; Opuntia In Latin)</h2>
<p>Our herb of the month is an edible one, often eaten as a vegetable for its medicinal benefit. Prickly pear cactus is a ubiquitous sight throughout the Southwest, with a wider range of growth than most cacti species, and is a very attractive one now for its April display of yellow or pink flowers. The green pads are the most distinctive part of the plant. They are oval or marquis shape flattened and about a foot long. They grow end to end and are often at right angles to each other. For this unusual appearance, the plant is used in landscaping, and even as material for a fairly dense, impenetrable living fence, which is a popular form of property boundary throughout Latin America. Mexican cuisine features nopal as an accompaniment to eggs, or as dried nopalitos.</p>
<p>So where&#8217;s the medicine in all this? Prickly pear is a very useful food for diabetics, because the presence of prickly pear in a meal has been found to lower the glycemic index for the foods it accompanies. [1, 2]</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;">How do you treat cancer?</h2>
<p>I am a primary care physician, a <a title="About Us" href="https://natureworksbest.com/about-us/">Naturopathic Medical Doctor</a>. I use natural treatments for cancer and other diseases. That is I use no chemotherapy, radiation or surgery. However, I do work with oncologists, the formal name for doctors who are cancer specialists.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">How do you work with oncologists?</h2>
<p>There are 2 types of oncologists in my experience: the old-fashioned kind, who only knows about chemo and radiation and surgery, and who are not interested in <a href="https://natureworksbest.com/">natural treatments for cancer</a>. Some have shown a lot of hostility toward natural treatments for cancer. They have not been very cooperative with me regarding the patients that we share. And this has been detrimental to the patients&#8217; well being, because necessary information such as PET scans, MRI&#8217;s etc. have been withheld by them.</p>
<p>However, there is a new forward-thinking, well-informed and open-minded type of oncologist, and they are taking an interest in the successes and tumor regression and remission that we have experienced with natural treatments. These oncologists have been completely cooperative about sharing information from CT scans, PET scans, blood work, etc., and the patient benefits from this shared information. Some of my patients have these newer kinds of oncologists, fortunately. One such oncologist even told my patient that he would do what the patient is doing &#8211; that is, the natural treatments &#8211; if he himself had cancer, and that he had nothing better to offer for this patient&#8217;s pancreatic cancer. That kind of honesty is very welcome to the patient, as well as to the public. Certainly oncologists do have a lot to offer to cancer patients, often lifesaving help. But when they cannot help, it makes most sense for them to welcome the natural treatments that do make a difference.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s one reason the new generation of oncologists takes an interest in what we&#8217;re doing. We are now seeing that cancer is the most threatening epidemic of our time. It touches almost every family or extended family. This new type of oncologist is awake and smelling the coffee. If natural treatments are helpful, they might need to keep us naturopaths around in case any of their loved ones are stricken with this disease. Also, there is a genuine desire on the part of many conventional doctors to act with the patient&#8217;s best interests as a priority, despite where that road may go.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">What natural treatments do you use?</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s important to understand that that depends entirely on the patient. Each of my cancer patients came in with a different type of cancer and different pattern of metastases. Yet I have not lost any patient who followed my treatment program to death from any cause, which I will discuss further below.</p>
<p>As for an example of a specific treatment, let&#8217;s say a cancer patient has lung involvement. Then I will deliver anticancer medicine to the lungs by way of a nebulizer. This has been helpful with both primary lung cancers as well as secondary metastases to the lungs. What I put in there is a combination of herbs and nutrients, in a form that is tolerable to the airways.</p>
<p>More commonly though, I will offer intravenous anti-cancer nutrients, such as massively high doses of Vitamin C.</p>
<p>Linus Pauling is the only person in history to be awarded two solo Nobel prizes. His work with Vitamin C and cancer was groundbreaking decades ago. Now we know that we can use much higher doses of Vitamin C than Dr. Pauling did without side effects, and get even better results than he did in his day.</p>
<p>There are also herbs that have tremendous effect in slowing the growth of cancer and inhibiting metastases, so we use those when appropriate. Renée Caisse was a Canadian nurse who worked with the Ojibwa people, and together they put together a formula of herbs that works very well, and has a long history of productive use with cancer, called Essiac, so I often use that. But certainly not alone.</p>
<p>Several other cancer-fighting strategies are available from nature. For example, if a person is very acid, and their blood or urine shows high acidity, then I work extra hard to alkalinize them, because cancer cells only thrive in acid, not alkaline conditions. Several natural substances will alkalinize the body. I use some intravenously, and some are taken orally. The ones I like best are the ones that are attracted to the tumors and are more active there.</p>
<p>The different treatments for different patients can be expensive for some patients, which then further limits the number of treatments that they opt to receive.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">How does Vitamin C work?</h2>
<p>One thing that <a title="Our Vitamin-C Cancer Therapy" href="https://natureworksbest.com/vitamin-c-cancer-therapy/">Vitamin C</a> does is change the surface tension of cancer cells and to set them up for apoptosis, or death of the cell, which is what normal cells do naturally. Cancer cells are a problem partly because they are immortal, at least until we go in there with Vitamin C and other treatments and make them mortal.</p>
<p>Another effect of Vitamin C is a little complicated, but bear with me. We know from the 2005 Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences [1], that Vitamin C used intravenously, hardly at all orally, but by IV, will increase the body&#8217;s own concentration of hydrogen peroxide in the extracellular fluid. Here&#8217;s the bottom line: Vitamin C makes the cancer cells to be bathed in extra oxygen, which kills cancer cells.</p>
<p>And better yet, and confirmed by the research, Vitamin C selectively kills cancer cells, and not normal cells. Which is why the patients feel good and keep their hair. Because we are not killing normal cells.</p>
<p>Plus Vitamin C is necessary to human survival. We have Vitamin C throughout our bodies, inside and outside our cells, unless we have severe scurvy, which is a deadly disease.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Does insurance cover any of this?</h2>
<p>Things are changing very rapidly here. Just in the last few months, the major insurance companies have begun to cover naturopathic treatments much more than before, as they realize that we save them quite a bit of money over conventional medicine. Unfortunately, Medicare is still not covering this. But since insurance coverage is improving so rapidly, I am expecting Medicare to come around too.</p>
<p>CIGNA has been best at covering naturopathic medicine. Aetna and United Health Care are trying to catch up. Even Blue Cross/Blue Shield and Humana, which never used to cover naturopathic services, are beginning to get with the times.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Does the FDA approve of any of this?</h2>
<p>All treatments that I use for cancer are natural substances, not synthetic, and all are available in some form or other to the general public, over the counter. However, the quantities and form differ greatly, if you really want to have a fighting chance against such a vicious disease as cancer. Some of this has to be given intravenously in order to be really effective against cancer. You can&#8217;t just get enough or the right amounts and proportion and form of these simply by visiting the health food stores. Although for certain items, I ask all of my patients, whether they have cancer or not, to go buy this or that item at the health food stores. I located my office near Whole Foods and Sunflower for that reason.</p>
<p>So yes, it&#8217;s all legal, all within the scope of practice of naturopathic physicians here in Arizona, licensed by the State of Arizona, with oversight by the Naturopathic Physicians Board of Medical Examiners, and our medical schools are accredited by the US Department of Education. There are 14 states total as well as the District of Columbia that license naturopathic medicine. They are (roughly from west to east, north to south): Hawaii, Alaska, Washington, Oregon, California, Idaho, Montana, Utah, Arizona, Kansas, Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Connecticut and Washington DC.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">What happens to the patients?</h2>
<p>Not only have the patients who followed my treatment plan all survived, but also only 2 patients have had decreased vitality during the time that they have been coming to me for my help. Now I tell my cancer patients (only half jokingly) that they&#8217;re not allowed to be the first one to go downhill. All of my chart notes in my files document that what I am saying is true.</p>
<p>As for what happens to the cancer patients, first, they start feeling better and their energy comes back. One patient just built a bathroom in his house with his own hands, hauling around tile and everything. This is while I was treating him for cancer. Another just went for a 3-mile walk recently, and then another walk on a beach in a strong wind. She has Stage 4 malignant melanoma. Or had; we got rid of the primary cancer and the metastasis to the brain, and we are now working on the last metastasis, a small tumor the size of a blueberry. That kind of well-being and strength and vitality shown by these patients usually begins within the first week or two after I start treating them, long before we have evidence from the CT scans, MRI or PET scans of shrinking tumors. Then the evidence comes back of shrinking tumors or tumors that are no longer there. Sometimes there will be new metastases while the primary tumors are shrinking. But that&#8217;s okay; we just keep fighting the cancer relentlessly till we win.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">5 Simple Things You Can Do To Improve Your Health</h2>
<ol>
<li>Externalize stress.</li>
<li>Internalize joy.</li>
<li>Eat foods in their raw, natural state.</li>
<li>Get sunshine every week.</li>
<li>Exercise.</li>
</ol>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Externalize Stress</h2>
<p>This is the hardest of the five on this list, but essential to maintaining good health.</p>
<p>In stressful situations, adrenalin, which is now known as epinephrine, is secreted from the adrenal glands on top of the kidneys. When this happens heart rate increases, blood pressure increases, a miserable sense of doom or failure or fear clouds over the mind. As you can imagine, none of this is very good for your health. In the book, Why Zebras Don&#8217;t Get Ulcers, Robert Sapolsky looks at the different ways that humans experience and process their stress. Unlike zebras who can either stay and fight in a herd, or run away from their stressors, we have trickier stressors in our lives &#8211; getting behind on our mortgage payments, dealing with rush hour traffic, a family member who is inconsiderate of others.</p>
<p>Deepak Chopra MD is famous partly because of his ability to bring practices of serenity from the east to our frenzied western hemisphere. Dr. Chopra teaches how to externalize stress in his numerous published books. A large part of a person&#8217;s stress comes from the assumption, whether real or imagined, that you can do something about a stressful situation. Whether you can correct a stressful situation or not, it is important to understand that the intolerable situation is external to your mind and emotions, even if the stress is related to your own health condition. Things will happen as they happen, and you generally cannot change them. Of course, sadness is an appropriate response to a bad situation, or better yet, trying productively to change it. But if there&#8217;s nothing that can be done, then the biggest favor you can do for yourself is to begin to accept it, and stay healthy and strong. Your punishing yourself with a sense of panic or a higher blood pressure is a typical response, but it accomplishes nothing. The serenity prayer may come in helpful when external stressors loom large. &#8220;God grant me the courage to change the things I can, the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, and the wisdom to know the difference.&#8221;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Internalize Joy</h2>
<p>With joy and success and beautiful things in life, even if they seem to happen more to other people than to you, allow yourself to bask in their good fortune. There is much about life that is incredibly beautiful, and what you consider to be good in life really does not have to conform to any rigid set of standards. Let me give you a few examples from my own life.</p>
<p>I maintain a low threshold for happiness, which means that I derive much of my happiness from pretty much any old thing, just everyday household events: I can lose myself in complete contentedness simply pulling weeds in my garden or transplanting seedlings. Every new flower or fruit is a source of new delight and a reason to pester the next person I see with my &#8220;garden report.&#8221; But for years I did not have a garden, and for some of the year not much is happening back there. So there are other things that make life wonderful . . .</p>
<p>I once lived in a little town at the bottom of a mountain and taught classes at a small college at the top of the mountain. Every day I hiked to work for about an hour, then walked back home at the end of the day, including in rainy weather. The exercise, fresh air, and mountain views were fantastic regardless of the weather. But I don&#8217;t live or work there anymore, so there are other things that make life wonderful . . .</p>
<p>I derive immense joy from my little son, playing with him, teaching him, watching him grow. But for most of my life, I did not have a child, and my joy came from teaching other youth, volunteering at an emergency room and many other activities.</p>
<p>In other words, your source of happiness does not require special events or lots of money or unusual circumstances or particular locations or individuals. Happiness is not miles away on a distant beach or cruise ship or casino or on Mt. Everest; it lies no further than the boundaries of your house or yard or workplace or neighborhood. It consists of nothing more or less than those activities, people, or experiences that bring you the most pleasure and fulfillment and/or hope for the future.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Eat Foods In Their Raw, Natural State</h2>
<p>Humans have been so intimately connected to plants for all of our existence as a species that we cannot live without them. We connect with plants and exchange with plants down to our very cells and our smallest molecules. That is why they heal us like nothing else can. Our historical reliance on plants has been an integral part of every human society. Plants and humans resonate on levels that are still beyond our comprehension, including biochemical and physiological levels, and some would say aesthetic and emotional as well. How could humans and plants so closely have shared this earth, one with the other, and not had complementary, multi-faceted relationships with each other? Hippocrates said, &#8220;Let your food be your medicine and your medicine be your food.&#8221; Medicine is what you get when the most appropriate plant is given to an ill person. The plant kingdom does play the major role of all foods in this wonderfully beneficial relationship for us.</p>
<p>Yet, we live at a strange crossroads in history. Over the last few decades, the human species has been hypnotized by the temptations offered by the chemical and pharmaceutical industries. The 1950&#8217;s ushered in the &#8220;better living through chemicals&#8221; age. And we believed, and we bought and swallowed and injected and are still consuming them in massive amounts, and, most recklessly, injecting such chemicals as ethyl mercury, ethylene glycol (antifreeze), aluminum and formaldehyde into our babies as part of vaccines, without any prior safety testing.</p>
<p>But now with massive chronic disease plaguing our most industrialized populations, autism closely following children&#8217;s shots, and more pathology coincident with concentrated chemicals, we are beginning to wake up from our long post-World War II slumber. Now begins the next era when synthetic chemicals are starting to be seen as, however useful in many applications, best kept at a distance from our bodies, our homes, public spaces and wilderness.</p>
<p>The old era of unthinking reliance on a synthetic existence is showing severe disadvantages, just as the urgency to forge new relationships with nature is becoming apparent. Plants and other whole foods are coming into their own new era as naturopathic physicians and other well-informed health practitioners rely on them for their central role in healing. Within our lifetimes, I predict that whole food will eclipse pharmaceuticals in medical practice, as the general public awakens to its far superior healing capacity.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Get Sunshine Every Week</h2>
<p>Light really matters to your health. Bone health is greatly dependent on quality light. We make Vitamin D through our skin when exposed to optimal levels of sunlight. Vitamin D is key to a proper quantity and balance of calcium and magnesium in the body, as well as a healthy balance of hormones. A growing body of research demonstrates that by increasing one&#8217;s exposure to full spectrum light it is possible to optimize hormone levels in the body. Such balance is key to avoiding osteoporosis and fractures, as well as minimizing tooth decay.</p>
<p>Recent research has confirmed the essential role of Vitamin D in such necessary function as insulin secretion, cancer prevention, bone health and hormone formation.</p>
<p>Historically, osteoporosis and age-related fractures have hit hardest at those populations who stay in the dark. Contemporary Americans and Europeans who stay indoors much of the time have much higher rates of hip and other fractures than people whose lifestyle kept them outdoors or dependent on natural light. Only a century ago, we had no light bulbs at all, and we had no fluorescent lights until 50 years ago.</p>
<p>A nine-month long study of first grade children in windowless classrooms found that those under full-spectrum fluorescent lights had many fewer cavities in their newly formed permanent teeth than those under standard &#8220;cool white&#8221; fluorescent bulbs. It turned out that ten times as many children under cool white bulbs had new cavities.</p>
<p>Getting 10 to 15 minutes of sunlight on your face, hands and arms, between 8 a.m. and 3 p.m., two or three times a week, can supply all the Vitamin D you need. In fact, unlike other vitamins, Vitamin D is made best by the skin. The body actually produces Vitamin D while the sun&#8217;s ultraviolet B rays hit the skin. It is technically a hormone and important precursor of the steroid hormones in the body.</p>
<p>Many people are deficient in Vitamin D, and it cannot be well absorbed from supplements. Even then, supplement makers usually use the cheap and useless D2, which is not the high quality D3 (1,25 cholecalciferol) that your skin makes. Vitamin D is absorbed sufficiently but not excessively from sunlight. The body efficiently eliminates any extra Vitamin D acquired from sunlight. However, it is possible to get a toxic high dose from Vitamin D supplements.</p>
<p>In fact, Dr. Edward Giovannucci, a Harvard University professor of medicine and nutrition, at his keynote lecture for the American Association for Cancer Research conference, says that Vitamin D may help prevent 30 deaths for each one caused by skin cancer.</p>
<p>Dr. Giovannucci said, &#8220;I would challenge anyone to find an area or nutrient or any factor that has such consistent<a title="Dr. Huber’s Nutrient Infusions" href="https://natureworksbest.com/dr-hubers-nutrient-infusions/" target="_blank"> anti-cancer</a> benefits as Vitamin D. The data are really quite remarkable.&#8221; As a result of Dr. Giovannucci&#8217;s speech the American Cancer Society is now reviewing its own sun protection guidelines. Dr. Giovannucci&#8217;s research has determined that 1500 IUs of Vitamin D per day are necessary to significantly curb cancer, by simply stifling abnormal cell growth and formation of blood vessels that feed tumors. [1]</p>
<p>The plot thickens when we look at sunscreens. Ingredients that are ubiquitous in the mass-marketed sunscreens, methoxycinnamate, oxybenzone, etc., have been shown to increase penetration of neurotoxins, [2] change to unstable chemical compounds [3] and stimulate growth of cancer. [4]</p>
<p>Wait a minute, you might think. Conventional dogma holds that sun = bad, sunscreen = good. At least that&#8217;s the baa-baa baloney that we obedient sheep have been taught to bleat for many years now. Isn&#8217;t it funny how every time the nastier the chemical, the more villainous the natural alternative is made out to be? It seems like every time &#8211; especially if no one can make money from the natural item. The sun has an especially bad habit of shining for free, the scoundrel, and thus thwarting efforts to patent, market or export it.</p>
<p>Of course, one should not sunbathe to the point of burning, because sunburn itself damages the skin. But beware of complacency using sunscreens. The research cited shows that they create cancer more certainly than they prevent it.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Exercise</h2>
<p>Of all the good things you can do for your own health, exercise is probably the most important. When you consider the structure of our bodies, the way our feet and legs are shaped, as well as our hands and arms, our bones and muscles, it becomes clear that we were made to move.</p>
<p>It has been said that even the weakest among us can work very hard and become an athlete. But even the strongest, most Herculean among us cannot long survive a sedentary lifestyle.</p>
<p>The many benefits of exercise are too long to list: improved blood flow is one such benefit, which itself is healing to most health problems throughout most of the body. From broken bones to heart disease, from diabetes to wound repair, blood heals, and the better the flow, the better the healing.</p>
<p>Exercise provides much better longevity, and perhaps much more important, grants you increased comfort inside your own body. Considering your body is either the pleasant sanctuary and temple of your life that it should be, or a painful, uncomfortable prison with a life sentence for you, exercise becomes all the more urgent and necessary.</p>
<p>The trick is to find exercise that is fun and accessible, so that you will be sure and do it, and hopefully look forward to it. I recommend 3-6 times per week of at least a half hour moving each time. An hour would be even better. And no it doesn&#8217;t have to be the perfect exercise. Walk, run, skate, bike, golf or play a team sport or go to a gym, but just be sure to do something to get yourself moving.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;">Low Thyroid</h2>
<p>The thyroid gland, one of the most unremarkable features of our anatomy, not even large enough usually to make a bulge at the front of the neck where it resides, is actually quite important to good health and well-being.</p>
<p>People with severe hypothyroidism, the clinical term for low thyroid function, have rather obvious symptoms of constantly feeling cold, fatigue and a tendency to gain weight, with nearly impossible efforts to lose weight. Often such symptoms are striking enough to come to the attention of medical personnel sooner or later, and the patient is dosed for life with synthetic thyroid hormone, which supplements the low output of the under performing thyroid gland.</p>
<p>However, there are other symptoms, potentially much more devastating, that for many people are the result of low thyroid function. Broda Barnes, MD shook up conventional thinking about the thyroid in 1976, when he showed connections between low thyroid and heart disease. He also showed a clear connection from low thyroid to elevated blood fats and blood cholesterol. This is something that is still every bit as true today, but is still largely ignored by the medical community. The ignorance has turned out to be convenient, because cholesterol-lowering medications are so much more expensive and enriching than thyroid hormones for the pharmaceutical companies. Whereas thyroid supplementation may not only resolve the underlying cause of high cholesterol, it would also likely help the patient with mood, energy and weight management.</p>
<p>So low thyroid function is grossly under diagnosed. It may seem odd that so many people have low thyroid function, but if you consider the various environmental threats to the thyroid, it is a wonder that any of us have that gland working at all.</p>
<p>Here are some of the most prevalent threats to the thyroid gland:</p>
<ul>
<li>Background radiation: Cell phone towers have proliferated in large and small metropolitan areas. Cordless phones and microwaves are used in most households. Electromagnetic fields bathe our houses and workplaces continuously. All of this radiation damages the thyroid.</li>
<li>Other radiation: X-rays do more thorough and immediate damage to the thyroid. Always make sure you are given a shield to cover your neck when having dental or any other x-rays.</li>
<li>Estrogen is everywhere. Car exhaust, plastics, pesticides, even chemicals in our shampoos and other soaps have estrogen-like chemical compounds. These substances interfere with the production of thyroid hormone, and they are everywhere in our industrial-to post-industrial society. Even men in our society are estrogen-dominant.</li>
<li>Soy deserves special mention as an increasingly common problem for the thyroid. Soy is a plant that has become popular in agriculture because it will grow where other plants can no longer grow. It does this because it is very efficient at pulling minerals out of the soil. Then once the molecules of soy get into you, they pull out your minerals too. The thyroid, being an especially mineral dependent gland, is especially weakened by soy. Soy is therefore known as a goitrogen, and should be avoided, except as a condiment</li>
<li>Selenium is a common mineral in rich natural topsoils, but has become depleted over the years in our soils because of monoculture, lack of composting and other unhealthy farming practices. Selenium is crucial to the thyroid hormone conversion that must take place in order for us to benefit from our thyroid output. See you naturopathic physician for help in supplementing good amounts of this and other nutrients.</li>
</ul>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Treatment Options For Low Thyroid</h2>
<p>Fortunately, the low thyroid patient has many options, perhaps more than for almost any other condition, especially if the hypothyroidism is mild. As a Naturopathic Medical Doctor and primary care physician, I like to take the gentlest measures first. For example, after I order several different tests in a &#8220;panel&#8221; of thyroid tests, I can determine if nutritional deficiencies are relevant to the patient&#8217;s condition. Then I supplement a number of nutrients to enhance thyroid function. However, those same tests may tell me that more than a little intervention is needed. Still there are amino acids and/or herbs that may be sufficient.</p>
<p>If more intervention is needed there are a number of glandular options available; usually thyroid gland derived from sheep and then encapsulated as a supplement to the thyroid. Even this much of an intervention may still be therapeutic and repairing to one&#8217;s own thyroid, as are all of the above-mentioned treatments.</p>
<p>Finally, if none of the above-mentioned treatments are sufficient or appropriate to the patient&#8217;s needs, there are pharmaceutical options among the synthetic thyroid hormones.</p>
<p>In any case, it is a story with a quick and happy ending for most patients, because the hypothyroid symptoms can often soon be eliminated by appropriate treatment.</p>
<p>A first step would be to consult your local naturopathic physician. The largest directory of naturopathic doctors is www.naturopathic.org.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;">Sports Nutrition Basics</h2>
<div>This is the first in a series of articles on nutrition for special needs. The following is from a talk I recently gave at Whole Foods in Tempe Arizona to runners getting ready for a marathon. I reprint it here, because the principles below apply equally to all sports participants, even if that amounts to no more than a half hour on the elliptical machine or a brisk walk in the neighborhood. With these guidelines, you will also quickly be able to exercise more and longer and become stronger for the duration of your workout.</div>
<p>There are a couple of ways to look at your nutrition needs for running a marathon &#8211; that is long-term needs and immediate short-term needs, both of which have to be considered if you&#8217;re going to do a great job. I&#8217;m going to cover both in this talk, and it&#8217;s not too late for you to improve both for this upcoming marathon.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Sweat Contains 60 Essential Minerals</h2>
<p>It may be tempting to only look at the immediate needs of this upcoming event, but it takes long-term nutrition as well. Consider this: an athlete sweats out more in one day than a sedentary person does in 2 weeks. And as we all know, that&#8217;s not just water coming out in your sweat.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s consider this from a bookkeeping point of view. Sweat contains 60 (that&#8217;s six-zero) essential minerals. All of these are on their way out of your body faster &#8211; that&#8217;s a subtraction, like spending money that you don&#8217;t really have &#8211; coming out of you 15 times faster than a couch potato. Exercise without nutritional supplementation is a negative, going deeper into a debt that is only eventually paid off with illness or death.</p>
<p>Now when I say an athlete spends that much, you might be thinking well, I&#8217;m not at the top of the elite athletes, not an Olympian, not even a national competitor yet. That&#8217;s okay, because I am addressing these words to all of you &#8211; if you even go to a gym three times a week, or run a couple of times a week &#8211; this applies to you. And here&#8217;s the bottom line, if you do not replace those minerals you lose every time you work out, you are not going to make it to a healthy old age. And worse yet, you are going to simply go downhill miserably the last 10 to 15 years of your life.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"> Long Term Nutrition</h2>
<p>Long-term nutrition even if it starts now, shortly before the marathon, has to consist of more than the average sedentary person uses:</p>
<ul>
<li>More minerals</li>
<li>More vitamins</li>
<li>More antioxidants</li>
<li>More amino acids</li>
<li>More enzymes</li>
</ul>
<p>So here is what you should take as far as nutritional supplementation goes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Liquimins Vita Minerals &#8211; 1 capful/day</li>
<li>Trace Minerals Research &#8220;Electrolyte Stamina&#8221;, 2-3 packets/day separately</li>
</ul>
<p>This will give you the basic minerals that you need, plus the water-soluble vitamins, as well as a good start on antioxidants.</p>
<p>I also like the food-source nutrients a lot because of their bioavailability. They really don&#8217;t have the high-quantity that athletes need for intense activity, but can be used on your days off from training. They are, however, the best quality and most bio-available. So alternate one of these with the above. These bio-available nutrients are (choose one): New Chapter&#8217;s &#8220;Every Man&#8221; or &#8220;Every Woman,&#8221; that&#8217;s 6 tablets/day.</p>
<p>The other main one in this category is &#8220;Living Multi,&#8221; which is 9 tablets/day. So choose one of those for a high-quality whole food source of nutrients.</p>
<p>If you feel that that is too many pills to swallow, or if your budget does not permit either of these latter two, and if you only engage in moderate exercise, please consider at least getting &#8220;Only One&#8221; by New Chapter, which is just one tablet.</p>
<p>These will round out your intake of enzymes and phytonutrients, in addition to basic vitamins and minerals.</p>
<p>As far as food intake, that cannot be ignored, and supplements will never take the place of it. Here this evening in Whole Foods, you are right now in the Rolls Royce of food stores &#8211; or maybe it&#8217;s the Toyota Prius, because it&#8217;s environmentally in the vanguard. What I mean is the very high quality and large variety of organic foods here. And they are not paying me to say this. I am here tonight on a volunteer basis. And I&#8217;m mainly talking about the produce aisle and the meat section.</p>
<p>First, fruits and vegetables. Folks these are not an option; these are not for other people; these are not just for vegetarians. You cannot, repeat: cannot be healthy without whole fruit (not juiced), whole fruit and vegetables.</p>
<p>I want you to spend quite a bit more time in the produce aisle than you have before. I want you to buy at least one vegetable that you don&#8217;t remember ever eating, or that you haven&#8217;t eaten since childhood. And if that means you go home with brussel sprouts or rutabaga, so be it.</p>
<p>You have to have at least four fruits and/or vegetables per day. And I would like you to have more like ten. If that means you have to get a cookbook and learn to cook, so be it. If that means you have to rely on Organic Bistro, which is a pretty new brand of organic TV dinners, that&#8217;s a good option. Their ingredients are only whole organic foods, without preservatives or additives.</p>
<p>And if you&#8217;ve never really relied on your own cooking, if you need to get started on how to cook whole food from scratch and keep your day job, that is a major theme of my book, Choose Your Foods Like Your Life Depends On Them.</p>
<p>Next I want to mention meat, because most of us eat at least some meat and/or poultry and/or seafood. For vegetarians, stay tuned, and I&#8217;ll get to you in a moment.</p>
<p>Here there are more and better options for meat than there was anywhere even a year ago. Now you have the option of 100% grass-fed organic beef, and poultry. No hormones, no antibiotics. There are options in fish for wild Alaskan and other wild caught seafood. So consider those.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">If You Are Vegetarian</h2>
<p>If you are vegetarian, you have to go to a bit more trouble to get adequate protein. The reason we all need protein is that the body breaks protein down to amino acids. Those amino acids are then used as the bricks and mortar, building blocks of the proteins that make up our own bodies, that is the flesh and bones, the various structures that comprise the body.</p>
<p>For vegetarians, I would be careful of soy, unless you have it fermented, such as in traditional Asian foods, such as miso, tamari, etc. But if you have it in larger unfermented doses, such as soymilk or soy protein powder, which are unfermented, it is too similar to the female hormone estrogen. And this we really don&#8217;t need. Not even post-menopausal women can gain much from soy, much less anybody else.</p>
<p>However, there is a more serious threat from soy for an athlete. And that is that soy is popular in agriculture right now because it grows in depleted soils that have been over-farmed. It does this because it is very good at grabbing minerals out of the soil. Well when those same soy molecules get into your body, they grab the minerals out of you too. For this reason, soy is known as a goitrogen, or something that can damage the thyroid gland, the thyroid being very mineral-dependent.</p>
<p>Soy is particularly bad for an athlete, because as I said in the beginning, athletes are sweating out minerals like a hole in your wallet can spill money. So the last thing you need is soy.</p>
<p>If you are vegetarian, then what I would do is alternate whey protein powder with rice protein, to get the benefits of both. But also keep in mind that an excellent complete protein can be made by combining a whole grain with a legume. Think of the Latin American solution to that: rice and beans. Also lentils and millet make a delicious, protein-rich combination that would benefit anyone, not just vegetarians. When it comes to legumes, think of some you have not had before, perhaps black-eyed peas or navy beans.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">The Third Major Component Of Food; Fat</h2>
<p>So we talked about two of the three main components of foods: carbohydrates (that is, fruits and vegetables) as well as protein (meats and the vegetarian alternatives). Now I have to address the third major component of food, which we have been taught to cringe when we hear, and that is fat.</p>
<p>I would not have a low-fat or non-fat diet. One, it does not work for weight loss or anything else. And because the brain is 60% fat, and requires high-quality fat, you can become depressed and/or cognitively debilitated without fat.</p>
<p>The important point is to get high-quality fat into your diet, and for that, you need the Omega-6, Omega-9, but especially the Omega-3 fats, which are especially loved by the body and brain.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t recommend highly enough that you get cod liver oil, especially during the winter months. Cod liver oil has all the advantages of fish oil, that is being a basic brain food, and it also has Vitamins A and D, which are necessary for strong functioning of your immune system, as well as many other cancer-preventing, bone strengthening and other benefits. I like the Carlson&#8217;s and the Nordic Naturals brands, because they are distilled.</p>
<p>If you are vegetarian you will get some of these benefits from flax oil. And to supplement Vitamin D, you are living in the best place on earth. Arizona gets more sunlight per square foot per unit time &#8211; that is the least cloud cover &#8211; than anywhere else in the world. And with mild temperatures in the middle of the day, try to have the face and lower arms exposed for an average of 20 minutes per day. Or you could get an hour on Saturday and an hour on Sunday. And I mean without sunscreen. Don&#8217;t sunbathe for hours or fall asleep in the sunlight. But a judicious two hours a week of sunlight in divided doses is great for getting your vitamin D intake.</p>
<p>Water of course is critical. You know that by the time you get thirsty, you are way late in hydrating yourself. If your urine is amber colored, you are way late. With drinking water, the trick is to make a routine out of it, so you don&#8217;t get into that deficit. Early in the day, get about half of your total daily intake, so that getting busy or distracted later doesn&#8217;t mean that you have to get dehydrated.</p>
<p>I promised to get to the immediate needs of the upcoming marathon. For intense events of more than 90 minutes duration, you should start going into a high-carbohydrate diet for two to three days before the event, because that is a good amount of time to stock your glycogen storage full for the event. This would be about 70 percent of your calories coming from carbohydrates.</p>
<p>Endurance athletes eating such a diet have been able to exercise longer than when on more typically balanced diets of 40-30-30, which is carbs, proteins, and fats.</p>
<p>Here is where many athletes make a huge mistake. Carb loading for them becomes sugar loading, and the bike stores and other stores that appeal to athletes are full of sugar treats. This is about the biggest mistake you can make. If you eat a lot of sugar days before an event, you are seriously compromising your performance. And if you consume sweets on the day of the event, you are inviting a surge of insulin, which will dip your blood sugar too low when you need it most to complete the job of the marathon. Worse yet, sugar draws your body fluids into the GI tract, the place that you least need those fluids to be during your marathon. This sets you up for muscle cramping, dehydration, nausea, diarrhea &#8211; who needs that?</p>
<p>Now if you want something that tastes like a sports drink and will give you sodium replacement during a long run, here is one that will not create the kind of problems that are caused by sugar or high fructose corn syrup or honey or maple syrup or any of those sugars.</p>
<p>So when I say load up on carbohydrates, I mean high-quality carbohydrates, which are complex carbohydrates, namely vegetables, whole fruits (not fruit juice) and whole grains. These are the only kinds of carbs that will do you any good &#8211; I don&#8217;t care how many different brands of sugar bars and sugar drinks are in the sports stores.</p>
<p>If you have any doubts about what I&#8217;m saying, please check out the research at Colorado State University, and summarized on their website, www.colostate.edu.</p>
<p>And no, you don&#8217;t need the fluorescent-color so-called sports drinks for the event. By the time of the event you have been getting plenty of minerals, so what you do need is water. Water is what you have several cups of, that is 6-7 cups on the day of the event, before the event, and it is what you carry with you throughout the event.</p>
<p>But if you have had a little too much water, you risk hyponatremia. Some symptoms of hyponatremia are headaches, muscle cramping, nausea, abdominal bloating, confusion, fatigue. So this is a sports drink that is good to pack with you. You take a quart bottle of water. Add a 1/3-teaspoon of sea salt and two droppers full of liquid stevia. Stevia is sweet, tastes pretty good for cold or room temperature beverages, and has zero glycemic index, so it does not act like sugar in the body. Nor is it an artificial sweetener. It comes straight from the plant, and you could grow it in your back yard if you wanted to. Before the big event, when you&#8217;re mixing this up, add two droppers full and see if that is sweet enough for you. If not, add another half dropper full, and another, tasting it with each addition. I would get the liquid stevia, not the powdered, because the liquid is easier to handle.</p>
<p>Sodium is the only electrolyte that you would want to replace during the event. The others can wait for after the event. That is, hyponatremia (which means low sodium in the blood) is a problem at times, whereas the other electrolyte deficiencies, such as hypokalemia &#8211; low potassium, or hypomagnesemia &#8211; low magnesium generally don&#8217;t present a problem during athletic events.</p>
<p>The pre-event meal is two to four hours ahead of time, and only about 1000 calories, again high in complex carbohydrates: vegetables, fruits, whole grains.</p>
<p>Now for after the event, when your heart rate settles down and you&#8217;ve cooled off, within the hour afterward, you have some nuts and a banana. This will replace your sodium and your potassium respectively, without messing with your blood sugar, and being appealing taste-wise.</p>
<p>These are basic guidelines that seem to work for the majority of athletes. However, there is some value in considering individual variation regarding carbohydrates. For example, some people do better on carbs in general than others. And it is worth considering that fats provide long-term energy, and should not be totally neglected before a race, and should still be 10-15% of total calories. To see how much you as an individual may vary from these recommendations, see William Wolcott&#8217;s work on Metabolic Type.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Herb Of The Month: Tea Tree (Melaleuca Alternifolia)</h2>
<p>Tea tree oil is a very popular product in health food stores, very handy for its anti-fungal and anti-bacterial effect, while being safe for topical use. Sometimes athlete&#8217;s foot and toenail fungus will respond better to repeated applications of tea tree oil than with any other application.</p>
<p>The name &#8220;tea tree&#8221; gives an incorrect impression. Actually the Australian aboriginal people call it &#8220;ti tree,&#8221; hence the name. It is only known to grow in Australia, although a few similar species grow in Indonesia and Malaysia also. Another reason that it is known as &#8220;tea tree&#8221; is because the fallen leaves in nearby streams turn the water a tea shade of brown, although this brew is not actually suitable for drinking. The oil is of medicinal effect and practical use.</p>
