<p>Cancer patients ask a reasonable question:&nbsp; What are my chances?</p>
<p>It is hard to get true numbers out of oncology clinics.&nbsp; As oncologist Dwight McKee MD has said, “Oncologists throw chemo at cancer for a little while, then send patients to hospice.”<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[1]</a>&nbsp; After several chemo drugs are tried, over the course of months to years, the cancer patient must then hear, “There is nothing more that can be done for your cancer.”&nbsp; This was after conventional oncology implied to the patient that a cure or at least prolonged remission was possible.</p>
<p>Oncologists also have a habit of telling an outright lie:&nbsp; “There is nothing else that works against cancer except chemotherapy and radiation.&nbsp; So you are going to start chemo this week.”</p>
<p>So then when patients learn the hard way how wrong that is, they get discouraged, distrust these doctors, realize that their cancer is now too strong and too widespread to try anything different, and they go to hospice, and then their death is blamed on cancer, rather than deception, poor treatments and mismanagement.</p>
<p>It just doesn’t have to be this way.</p>
<p>We published all the <a href="https://natureworksbest.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2017-Cancer-treatment-paper.2017.12.30.pdf">results</a> of our clinic online from 2009 to 2014, each year.<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2">[2]</a>&nbsp; Then when gathering the data each year got to be too detailed, time-consuming and burdensome, we started surveying patients currently in treatment, and with more focused questions.</p>
<p>Every oncology clinic should publish its results.&nbsp; This is the decent thing to do with cancer care.&nbsp; People need to know their odds.&nbsp; Doctors, patients have a right to know what you can and cannot do for them.&nbsp; If most of your patients die after a year or two of chemotherapy, then you have the obligation to disclose that to the public, so that people can make informed decisions.</p>
<p>And let them know early enough that they can get effective treatment for their cancer!</p>
