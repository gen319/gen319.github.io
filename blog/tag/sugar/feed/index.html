								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>by Colleen Huber, NMD</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p>If there was a single treatment that I could give to my cancer patients, one that is free of charge for life, tremendously effective and much safer to have than not have, that would be exercise.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p>Conversely, I have never seen any more widespread threats to duration and quality of life than these three risky behaviors: reckless driving, recreational substance abuse and a sedentary lifestyle.  Reckless driving, fortunately, is relatively rare, as most of us seem to be able to stay in our lane and stop at the red lights, with some remarkable and hair-raising exceptions on our roads and highways.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p>However, the most common major reckless behavior of our time, sedentary lifestyle, is casually indulged by a majority of 21<sup><span style="font-size: 9.6pt;">st</span></sup> century Americans.  It is casually indulged, as if there were no victims to this behavior, and as if no harm is expected to come of it.  Both assumptions are false, for the following reasons.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p>The American College of Sports Medicine recommends 150 minutes of exercise per week, broken up into any intervals, of any combination of sports or other movement, <i><u>for every living person</u></i>.  To state the obvious but incomprehensible:  This means you -regardless of who you are, your age, your pathetic excuses or your health condition.  This recommendation is for Americans of both genders and every last generation even at the extremes, and it is seconded by the Centers for Disease Control.<a id="_0"></a><a href="#_8"><sup><span style="font-size: 9.6pt;">i</span></sup></a>  The benefits of long-term exercise have been known throughout human history.  Hippocrates warned circa 400 BC, “Eating alone will not keep a man well.  He must also take exercise.”<a id="_1"></a><a href="#_11"><sup><span style="font-size: 9.6pt;">ii</span></sup></a></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p>I cannot tell you how many sedentary people come in to me amazed when they do not get better, having not comprehended my many exhortations to move and to move frequently, and that their very lives depend on it.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p>Yet contemporary Americans are content to leave sports to star athletes and youthful up-and-comers.  Only 1 in 5 Americans get the recommended 150 minutes of exercise per week.  The rest are literally time bombs for chronic disease.  Worse yet, nearly half of high school students – at or near peak physical performance of their lives &#8211; do not have a weekly PE class.<a id="_2"></a><a href="#_14"><sup><span style="font-size: 9.6pt;">iii</span></sup></a></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p>The recklessness of not exercising includes a greatly increased risk for Alzheimer’s Disease, as exercise is now known as the most effective intervention against onset and progression of Alzheimer’s.  This poses a threat not only to the wellbeing and quality of life of the individual, but to his safety and that of his family.  Likewise, the older woman who chooses not to exercise has increasingly brittle bones, a life-threatening hip fracture waiting to happen.  Pre-diabetes and full-blown Type II diabetes are far more prevalent among the sedentary, because lack of exercise impedes blood sugar metabolism.</p>
<p>The most stubbornly sedentary among us may be asking why humans are cursed with exercise as a pre-requisite and co-requisite of good health.  I may as well ask why I was cursed with having to nag people to move day after day and decade after decade, in order to help them to get well.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p>But it is not only these diseases that are very high risk for those with a sedentary lifestyle.  Cancer is more likely to strike the sedentary than the non-sedentary.   There you have it – the cause of cancer:</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p>In an experiment with mice that were genetically disposed to age prematurely, Mark Tarnopolsky of McMaster University in Ontario, divided the mice into two groups.  The first group of mice were sedentary.  The second group were coaxed on a treadmill three times per week.  As expected, the sedentary mice had weaker hearts, thin fur, worse hearing and were shivering in a corner.   The healthy mice had sleek coats, ran around their cages, reproduced.  However, with regard to cancer, when the mice were sacrificed at the end of the study, half of the sedentary mice had tumors.  <i>None</i> of the active mice had any tumors at all.<a id="_3"></a><a href="#_17"><sup><span style="font-size: 9.6pt;">iv</span></sup></a>  None!</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p>There could not be a more stark contrast between a group that’s high risk for cancer and a group that’s low risk than these sedentary versus active mice.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p>In my clinic, I exhort people to exercise, and I see all kinds of people.  Some are already on their treadmills or other exercise of their choice.  The majority tell me they don’t exercise much, and that they don’t mind going for a walk in the cool weather.  Here in the Phoenix area, some consider cool weather to be only the six months from mid-October to early April.  So I often hear from patients that they don’t want to walk, or haven’t been walking because it’s too hot.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p>We look for other forms of exercise that they would be willing to do.  We talk about in-home equipment, such as weights and stationary bikes.  I tell them that if they live close to a tennis court, they’ll play more tennis than me, or if they have a pool, that would be a great option.  Very many of my cancer patients find any exercise anathema, and content themselves with making plans for future exercise, rather than getting up today to start moving.  Sometimes the late-stage patients decide that they want to spend their days in a wheelchair, rather than the walker that we agreed on.  I almost always hate to see this, because, unless they are willing to lift weights and do some aerobic exercises while in the chair, I think the very act of starting to spend time in a wheelchair is going to shorten their lives.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p>But I am not giving up on any of my patients.  The ones in wheelchairs should lift cans of soup or similar weights, for 10 to 20 reps, 3 times per day.  The mobile patients should find ways to get to the 150 minutes or more.  I exercise about 270 minutes per week, and encourage that for the more fit ones.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p>Then there are those who insist that, either by laziness or inconvenience or distaste, they will not exercise, I tell them that they need to get into my hyperbaric chamber (HBOT) instead – a more expensive, and possibly not quite as good, alternative to exercise.   I recommend this second alternative, the HBOT, so that we can at least accomplish the major benefit that exercise confers in fighting cancer – the benefit of oxygen.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p>Oxygen uptake is perhaps the best benefit of exercise to a cancer patient.  Intense exercise maximizes oxygen uptake.  Oxygen at the cellular level is absolutely necessary to nourish our cells, to produce energy, to disassemble and eliminate waste products from our cells, to balance pH and to enhance our immune function.  These are essential tasks for the cells of non-cancer and cancer patients alike.  These tasks are necessary in the tissue of the cancer patient that we are trying to protect from metastasis, as well as for the tissue already damaged by cancer.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p>Decreased blood and oxygen flow to vital organs create the setting in which cancer takes its very first stab at the body.  In fact, a carcinogen, as defined by Otto Warburg, is a substance that deprives a cell of oxygen, and that causes that cell to convert from aerobic to anaerobic metabolism – the metabolism of cancer cells.  This, as Warburg showed almost 100 years ago, is the initial cause of cancer.  He studied many carcinogens, and found that what they had in common, every single one, was the ability to block the cell’s uptake of oxygen.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p>When you consider all the wasted research dollars and time attempting to chase quickly mutating genes to try to associate one more with cancer than others, with vanishing results, as one expensive lab test cannot reproduce another, the answer was right there all the time, and it is this:</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p>All cancer arises from oxygen deprivation to the cells.  All carcinogens have in common that they deprive cells of oxygen.  And the first part of the cell damaged is not the DNA, not the genes, not at all.  The first part of the cell that is damaged is the mitochondria, site of oxygen utilization and the electron transport chain.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p>Warburg said, “Cancer has only one prime cause.  The prime cause of cancer is the replacement of normal oxygen respiration of body cells by an anaerobic cell respiration.<a id="_4"></a><a href="#_19"><sup><span style="font-size: 9.6pt;">v</span></sup></a></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p>Cancer seems to be an “obligate anaerobe,” that is, that it requires to some extent an oxygen-free environment.<a id="_5"></a><a href="#_22"><sup><span style="font-size: 9.6pt;">vi</span></sup></a>  To the extent this is true, it makes cancer treatment easier.  Our solution: provide oxygen to the patient.  How do we do that?  If the sedentary patient sits comfortably while hooked up to an oxygen tank, this is not the best way to aerate the body.  Only the blood flow and increased lung work induced by exercise will get oxygen efficiently used in the body.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p>The point of all that effort is to get oxygen into the cell.  Let’s examine what happens when a normal cell receives increased oxygen.  Oxidative phosphorylation is the primary metabolic pathway.   The electron transport chain is engaged, as well the citric acid cycle, and the mitochondria are able to function in providing energy to the cell, to carry out cell functions, to thrive, eliminate wastes and reproduce.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p>In a cancerous cell, which is a formerly normal but now damaged cell, cellular respiration has converted to anaerobic.  When these cells are oxygenated, the remaining normal mitochondria in the previously damaged cell are able to return to normal function and resume metabolism as a normal cell.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p>Another oxygenating treatment that we do at my clinic is ozone.  Whereas oxygen is found in nature as O2, which is two oxygen molecules covalently bonded together, ozone is O3.  When we combine ozone with the cancer patient’s blood, in a short time the O3 breaks into O2 and a single O, which then is attracted to and grabs any nearby anaerobes.  This includes not only viruses and bacteria, but also cancer cells, destroying them.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p>Cancer cells have been shown in numerous studies to die in the presence of even a small amount of ozone.  One study showed lung, breast and uterine cancers dying at only 0.3 to 0.8 parts ozone per million, with the higher concentration killing more of the cancer cells.<a id="_6"></a><a href="#_25"><sup><span style="font-size: 9.6pt;">vii</span></sup></a></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<p>Likewise, hyperbaric oxygen therapy works similarly, yet more effectively.  By increasing pressure of room air in a closed environment, more oxygen from the room air is forced into the body and into the blood.  By Henry’s law, we know that pressure increases the plasma concentration of a gas.  In the case of 1.3 atm of room air, the resulting concentration of oxygen in the plasma is increased by 50%.<a id="_7"></a><a href="#_28"><sup><span style="font-size: 9.6pt;">viii</span></sup></a>  HBOT treatments have been a wonderful boon to natural health care, with very far ranging effects from neurological repair of many kinds, its most lauded and noteworthy effect, to wound-healing and the disruption of cancer metabolism.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;">Which Sweeteners Are Healthy?</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Which sweeteners are healthy to eat? <a href="https://natureworksbest.com/blog/2014/05/27/sugar-feeds-cancer-growth/">Do some sweeteners cause cancer</a>? There are many questions around natural and artificial sweeteners that we will touch on in this article. While many of the illnesses associated with cane sugar are still major health concerns especially in the United States, high fructose corn syrup is now the reigning king of junk food. Sodas, juices and other beverages and foods targeted to young children are now replete with high fructose corn syrup. As with many market forces, this new ascendance of high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) has to do with cost. HFCS has become cheaper to grow and incorporate into processed foods than cane sugar. Aside from cost, other factors, such as how easily it blends into foods has made it popular in the processed food industry.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Damage Caused By HFCS &amp; Cane Sugar</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Unfortunately, the health problems associated with HFCS are as bad or worse than regular cane sugar. Both have enormous health problems associated with them, and damage to all the major organs have been noted with ingestion of both. We can see some of the <strong>obvious damage caused by sugar</strong> since almost everybody has noted a child&#8217;s behavior becoming bad after sugar ingestion.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, on a more subtle level, <em>sugar causes damage</em> to the pancreas, the large intestine, the immune system, and other organ systems. For both sweeteners the white blood cells, which are the fighters of your immune system are inactivated after sugar ingestion, anywhere from 5 to 24 hours.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Both sugar and high fructose corn syrup cause accelerated aging, because of the oxidative damage to the cells and tissues of the body. If you are going to a spa or cosmetic surgeon to turn back the clock, then treating yourself with sugar or high fructose corn syrup afterward, you are rushing the clock forward again.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The insulin released by sugar or fructose ingestion also cakes a relentless plaque on the cardiovascular system, leading to heart disease. In fact, the three major killers of our time, heart disease, cancer and diabetes, are all related to consumption of these sweeteners.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">Health Problems Caused By HFCS</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And all of these health problems apply to high fructose corn syrup. However, HFCS has its own harmful effects. Fructose even more than sucrose interferes with copper metabolism, so that copper deficiencies result. This creates abnormalities in the heart and liver particularly. Copper deficiencies are increasingly common with the standard American diet. This is compounded by the fact that people no longer eat organ meats. Liver with onions was a staple back in the 60&#8217;s when I was growing up, yet it is a rarity in today&#8217;s diet. Liver is by far the best source of copper in food.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Fructose also interferes with your cells&#8217; uptake of insulin, just as happens in Type 2 Diabetes, which is the common kind of diabetes. Just as in diabetes, a fructose consumer must then pump out ever more insulin, which creates health problems everywhere in the body as it lays down a thick plaque in your arteries. This is why you may know of diabetics who have gone blind or developed kidney disease, or have had one extremity or another amputated. The reason is that the eyes, the kidneys and the fingers and toes are extraordinarily sensitive to blood flow and cannot function without a plentiful supply. Sooner or later, insufficient blood to these areas produces cellular death and the loss of the organ.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Fructose also is even worse than sugar regarding its depletion of minerals in the body. Magnesium is quite deficient in our society, the second most common nutrient deficiency after folic acid. Yet fructose leaches out magnesium and iron among other minerals. As a result of magnesium loss, headaches, constipation and muscle cramps may occur.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Abnormalities in the liver have been seen in animal experiments. Those fed high levels of fructose developed cirrhosis and fatty liver, which is the same liver pathology resulting from years of alcoholism or long-term use of most pharmaceuticals.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Heart disease is also a problem. HFCS has been tied to elevated blood cholesterol and has been shown to contribute to blood clots.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As you probably already know, two of the most devastating, non-traffic accident events that can happen to you, namely stroke and heart attack, are the result of a blood clot ending up in the wrong place. In a stroke, a blood clot has broken loose and traveled through your bloodstream, lodging in a narrow vessel in the brain, and cutting off all life in that part of the brain, downstream from the blood clot. In a heart attack, the same thing is happening, but the clot gets stuck in a small blood vessel in the heart, which kills that part of the heart. So much for sugar and high fructose corn syrup.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Aspartame, Splenda And Sucralose</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The artificial sweeteners, Aspartame, Splenda and Sucralose all have their origin in pesticide or military applications as chemical warfare, and should not be even remotely considered appropriate for entry into the body.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Unfortunately, aspartame is now the sweetener of choice in not only &#8220;diet&#8221; foods and sodas, but also most chewing gum and other products marketed to children for their ingestion. These products should never even be considered for adults or children. They have been tied to neurological disorders, from Parkinson&#8217;s to Multiple Sclerosis, simply because <strong>they are neurotoxins (nerve killers)</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The history of Splenda would be comical if it did not have such sad results in our population. While studying a neurotoxin one day in a lab, the senior researcher called out to the junior researcher &#8220;test it,&#8221; and the novice thought he heard &#8220;taste it&#8221; and called back &#8220;It tastes sweet.&#8221; The senior researcher came rushing in. &#8220;What? Are you crazy? I said test it, not taste it.&#8221; &#8220;But it&#8217;s sweet.&#8221; &#8220;Really? Let me have some of that.&#8221; So the senior researcher tastes it, smiles and a new chapter in synthetic foods begins. The full story of this episode appeared in The New Yorker magazine over a year ago.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Honey, unfortunately, isn&#8217;t much better at all. It is 82 percent sugar, and its glycemic index is either 83 or 124, depending on which glycemic table you look at. It is metabolized as sugar is, with the extreme highs and lows of unstable blood sugar, insulin flooding then crashing, and following the sickeningly familiar cycle of diabetes pathogenesis.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Stevia &#8211; The Healthy Sweetener</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I can only answer with one word: <strong>stevia</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">First I have to say that there is no stevia interest group or trade association or anybody else that would even want to bribe me to say this. Stevia is a South American plant that will grow all the way up to Canada, and even in arid conditions if it gets enough water. It will grow even at 110 degrees, and dies back if the weather goes below freezing. The sweetener is basically the crushed plant leaf, so there is no extra processing. Those same leaves can be put into a tea ball and steeped 30 minutes in warm water to create a liquid stevia extract &#8211; easy, fast and non-messy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For those of you without stevia plants in your backyard, stevia is sold by a number of brands in most major health food stores. It comes in the powdered extract as well as liquid. Personally I recommend the liquid as being more manageable because the powder gets airborne so easily that you will know and taste it easily if someone nears you pours it into food.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Stevia has a centuries-long history of safe use by native South American peoples. Hundreds of tests have now been performed around the world, and it has been found to be absolutely non-toxic. It is now among the most common sweeteners in Japan and several South American countries, and has been increasingly so for the last 20+ years.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Stevia may actually even be good for the teeth, which would be a radical first for a sweetener, because it has been shown to inhibit the development of plaque. Stevia also has zero <a href="http://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/glycemic-index-and-glycemic-load-for-100-foods" target="_blank" rel="noopener">glycemic index</a>. It won&#8217;t monkey with your sugar or insulin as the other sweeteners do.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The nutritive value of stevia is however negligible. After all, it only takes 2 to 6 drops of the liquid extract to sweeten a cup of coffee or tea. So even though there are phytonutrients, that is naturally occurring nutritious biochemicals in the plant that have nutritional benefit, you would not be able to stand eating even a whole leaf. At 200 times sweeter than sugar, it&#8217;s just too darn sweet!</p>

Film Review</h2>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">by Colleen Huber, NMD<br />
May 16, 2014</h4>
<p><em><strong>Fed Up</strong></em> is a movie that manages to present an enormous number of statistics in such an engaging way that you don’t realize to what extent you are learning and thinking through the whole 90 minutes. The subject of <em>Fed Up</em> is the obesity epidemic and the personal and devastating impact on several teenagers. Following their daily activities and hearing these kids’ frustration with their weight and their mostly fruitless efforts to lose weight brings a public health problem very effectively to the close and personal perspective.</p>
<p>More kids are fat than ever before. They are getting fat at a younger age. Over their heads, politicians, parents, and other adults are pointing fingers in every direction, except where they should be pointing.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Fed Up With Sugar</h2>
<p>Sugar. It’s in everything, at least in processed foods. It is the true culprit behind the obesity epidemic and the worst of our chronic diseases. In my book <a title="Amazon Link" href="https://www.amazon.com/CHOOSE-YOUR-FOODS-Like-Depends/dp/1425749283">Choose Your Foods Like Your Life Depends on Them</a> (2007), I drew the links between sugar consumption and diabetes, heart disease and <a title="Eating sugar doubles risk of death in cancer patients" href="https://natureworksbest.com/blog/2014/04/23/eating-sugar-doubles-risk-death-cancer-patients/">cancer</a>, both epidemiologically and biochemically. As a Naturopathic Medical Doctor, I have the medical training and experience to identify and treat these pathologies and to explain to my patients the mechanisms by which these develop. I wasn’t the first, and I won’t be the last to say that sugar is a public health disaster. Others with far bigger media attention have said the same. Whether it’s high fructose corn syrup, cane sugar, maple syrup, the artificial sweeteners, or even honey, sugar plays a huge role in the declining health of all age groups.</p>
<p><em>Fed Up</em> correctly points out that the addiction to sugar, fostered by the marketing of sugar to children has led to an intractable epidemic, which makes our society’s dalliance with tobacco look like a harmless caprice, a brief fling that we once indulged, in comparison. The financial might of the processed food industry towers over the power of the tobacco industry even at its peak. The lobbying money has meant that politicians of both sides of the political spectrum have been silenced on the subject of sugar. When a politician actually speaks out about sugar-laden processed foods, such as former NYC Mayor Michael Bloomberg or Sen Tom Harkin (D-IA), the industry whines about a nanny state “policing” our food, and that Americans are obese because we don’t exercise enough.</p>
<p>That’s nonsense, say a wide range of scientists, such as Robert Lustig, MD, well-known for his “<a title="The Bitter Truth Video" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBnniua6-oM">The Bitter Truth</a>,” which received over 4 million views on YouTube. There is no way that we could exercise enough to burn all of the calories that we consume. What makes us fat is not the calories; it is the sugar. Excess sugar provokes a rush of insulin out of the pancreas. Because that amount of sugar is too much to be immediately used, it gets stored as fat. Fat is easier for the body to make and store, and that is how we put it in reserve. Whereas dietary fat has been the scapegoat and so has salt, “What if it’s all been a big fat lie?” as Gary Taubes wrote in 2002. He was also interviewed in <em>Fed Up</em>.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Fed Up Conclusion</h3>
<p>Whatever one’s diet had been on entering the theater, and however strong the attraction to the candy bars displayed in the theater lobby afterward, it will no longer be a mindless act to choose to buy that candy or to keep walking past it toward the food actually recommended by the filmmakers: whole, natural food. <a title="Fed Up Movie" href="http://fedupmovie.com/"><em>Fed Up</em></a> will make sure that our food choices rise from automated grabs to thoughtful consideration.</p>
