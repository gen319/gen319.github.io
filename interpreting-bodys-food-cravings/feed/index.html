		<description><![CDATA[I was curious about this as well so I just went out a brought some of that Ancient Minerals magnesium oil. I did about 20 sprays in some water and this stuff is pretty rough haha. Would much rather some chocolate. But hopefully I won&#039;t be getting any of those cravings anymore. I will let you know if it works!]]></description>
